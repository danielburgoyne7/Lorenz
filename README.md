# Lorenz

This is a work-in-progress.

The project is an audio-visual program to synthesise [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) data to sound, in real-time. The parameters of the mapping scheme and Lorenz equations can be changed in real time.

Things to work on:
- User interface
- Granular synthesis in poly~ object that will allow the user to load their own sample
- Optimisation
- Fix audio distortion when many voices are active
- Work out how to create a graphical 'trail' effect for the coloured points
