# Lorenz

This is a work-in-progress.

The project is an audio-visual program to synthesise [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) data to sound, in real-time. The parameters of the mapping scheme and Lorenz equations can be changed in real time.

This project is based on the following video tutorials:
- [Null Phi Infinity | Lorenz Attractor tutorial in Max/MSP/Jitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEhHgMn3olg)
- [Amazing Max Stuff | Let's Start with Jitter! - OpenGL in Max 04 - jit.gl.sketch Lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s5qpCQcZNk)

Things to work on:
- User interface
- Granular synthesis in poly~ object that will allow the user to load their own sample
- Performance optimisation
- Fix audio distortion when many voices are active
- Work out how to create a graphical 'trail' effect for the coloured points
- Potential project report
